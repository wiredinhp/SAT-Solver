## SAT-Solver
# Input

Run the command `g++ SAT_solver.cpp` on linux terminal.
Run the command `./a.out`
Enter the file path when prompted. For e.g. `Test/Test1.cnf` 

# How to use test cases

There are 6 test cases named from `Test1.cnf` to `Test6.cnf` . `Solution1.txt` to `Solution6.txt` store the corresponding solutions of test cases.
Now follow the steps written in `Input` section above with the file name as `Test/Test1.cnf` to `Test/Test6.cnf`.


# Output
The program returns a txt file named `output.txt` 
If the formula is satisfiable, the file contains a model of the formula, else it shows that formula is unsatisfiable.
The output file also stores the execution time of the program.
